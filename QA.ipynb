      "CONCLUSIONS Although the mechanism of olfactory and gustatory function loss remains unclear [5], these preliminary clinical findings may indicate that relatively rapid recovery of olfactory and gustative function can mean a resolution of viral infection in most patients, and there was no distinction between hyposmia, anosmia and dysgeusia, contrary to what was found in other studies.[6] The analysis of our sample revealed that COVID-19 does not seem to cause permanent injury to olfactory and gustatory function because complete recovery occurs after two weeks.(From Paper: , Journal Pre-proofs Does COVID-19 cause permanent damage to olfactory and gustatory func- tion?
