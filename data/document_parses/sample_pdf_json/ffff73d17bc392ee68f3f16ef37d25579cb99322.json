            "text": "Since the COVID-19 disease caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared a pandemic, it has spread rapidly, causing one of the most serious outbreaks in the last century. Reliable and rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19 are crucial to control and manage the outbreak. Here, a label-free square wave voltammetry-based biosensing platform for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples is reported. The sensor was constructed on screen-printed carbon electrodes coated with gold nanoparticles. The electrodes were functionalized using 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) which was used for the immobilization of an antibody against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N protein). The binding of the immunosensor with the N protein caused a change in the electrochemical signal. The detection was realised by measuring the change in reduction peak current of a redox couple using square wave voltammetry at 0.04 V versus Ag ref. electrode on the immunosensor upon binding with the N protein. The electrochemical immunosensor showed high sensitivity with a linear range from 1.0 pg.mL \u22121 to 100 ng.mL \u22121 and a limit of detection of 0.4 pg.mL \u22121 for the N protein in PBS buffer pH 7.4. Moreover, the immunosensor did not exhibit significant response with other viruses such as HCoV, MERS-CoV, Flu A and Flu B, indicating the high selectivity of the sensor for SARS-CoV-2. However, cross reactivity of the biosensor with SARS-CoV is indicated, which gives ability of the sensor to detect both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The biosensor was successfully applied to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus in clinical samples showing good correlation between the biosensor response and the RT-PCR cycle threshold values. We believe that the capability of miniaturization, low-cost and fast response of the proposed label-free electrochemical immunosensor will facilitate the point-of-care diagnosis of COVID 19 and help prevent further spread of infection.",

Two main approaches are currently used for testing: the molecular methods based on the detection of the virus RNA via reverse transcriptase realtime polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the immunological and serological assays that focus on the detection of the virus antigens or antibodies [2] . The primary utilized method for the diagnosis of COVID 19 infection worldwide is the RT-PCR because of its sensitivity and selectivity. However, the high cost, time consumption and need for highly trained personnel and specialized laboratory equipment and reagents limit its use for population-wide testing particularly in lowresourced areas [4] . The immunological methods are mainly relying on the detection of the viral antibody that appears in the patient blood after few days of COVID-19 infection. However, this method is not useful for the early diagnosis of infection for the purpose of isolation or treatment [5] . Thus, detection methods for the antigens of the virus are more reliable for diagnosis.",

The immunosensor exhibited excellent sensitivity due to the large surface area and the high conductivity of the gold nanoparticles as well as high selectivity due to the specificity of the anti-N antibody. Moreover, initial testing of the immunosensor to detect the COVID infection in positive and negative samples indicated good correlation with the RT-PCR results. Therefore, this immunosensor is considered a promising low-cost, fast and sensitive diagnostic tool for COVID-19.",

As shown in Fig. 2a , the bare carbon electrode exhibited the characteristic CV with welldefined anodic and cathodic peaks of the redox couple with a peak-to-peak separation (\u0394E) of 0.24 V. After the deposition of the AuNPs on the carbon surface, the CV showed significant enhancement in the peaks current and a decrease of the \u0394E to 0.12 V. This enhancement in the current and decrease in the \u0394E indicate the increase in the electrochemical surface area and enhancement of the electron transfer rate of the electrode because of the AuNPs deposition. On the other hand, the functionalization of the AuNPs-modified electrodes with MUA led to a diminishing in the peak current and an increase in the \u0394E. This is likely due to the shielding of the electrode surface with the negatively charged carboxylic groups of the MUA causing repulsion of the redox anions from the surface. Then, after the activation of the carboxylic groups with EDC/NHS and the attachment of the anti-N antibody on the functionalized electrode, a slight increase in the cathodic peak current and diminishing of the \u0394E were observed. This could be attributed to the neutralization of some of the negatively charged carboxy moieties on the surface of the electrode with the antibodies. Binding Energy (eV) Fig. 1 Images of the electrodes by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for the bare carbon before (a) and after deposition of gold nanoparticles using 10 CV scans (b).

SWV measurements were recorded after each modification steps of the electrode, showing consistent results with CV. Figure 2b shows a remarkable increase in the reduction peak current on the AuNPs-modified electrode (red curve) in comparison to the bare carbon electrode (black curve). A decrease in the current was then observed after the functionalization with MUA, indicating the successful attachment of the thiol terminals of the MUA on the gold surface. An increase in the current was then observed after the antibody attachment on the working electrode W1 from the dual sensor followed by further decrease after the blocking of the sensors with BSA. The other working electrode (W2) was used as a control on which BSA was immobilized instead of the antibody. Thus, both CV and SWV results confirmed the successful fabrication of the immunosensor.",

Figure 3a shows the SWVs of the biosensor before (black voltammogram) and after (red voltammogram) incubation with 1 ng.mL \u22121 of the N protein solution. It was observed that the peak current was remarkably enhanced after the binding of the N protein to the immunosensor surface. This is likely attributed to the positive surface charge of the N protein at pH 7.4 which has an isoelectric point (IP) of 10.07 [37] . Therefore, the binding of the protein to the immunosensors causes an increase of the positive charges on the surface which in turn, attracts the redox anion and enhances the electron transfer. Similar behaviour has been previously reported with other positively charged proteins such as lysozyme [38] . Figure 3b shows the effect of the incubation time of the N protein with the immunosensor on the sensor response. The SARS-CoV-2 immunosensor response was calculated as the percentage of the increase in the SWV reduction peak current of the immunosensor upon binding with the N protein ((i-i o )/i %). It can be clearly seen that the immunosensor response to the binding to the N protein was increasing gradually with the incubation period until 15 min where the binding has almost reached plateau. Only a slight increase was observed after that. Therefore, 15 min was selected as the optimum time for further experiments.",

A gradual increase in the reduction peak current was seen after incubation of the immunosensor with an increased concentration of the protein likely due to the surface charge offered by the N protein as explained above. Figure 4b shows the SARS-CoV-2 immunosensor calibration plot (the immunosensor response ((i-i o )/i %) versus the logarithm of the N protein concentration. A straight line was observed with a linear regression equation: (i-i o )/i % = 119.3 + 33.2 log C [ng.mL \u22121 ] and correlation coefficient (R) of 0.998. The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) of the immunosensor were determined to be 0.4 and 1.3 pg.mL \u22121 , respectively. The LOD is calculated as 3S/b where S is the standard deviation of the blank signal and b is the slope of the calibration plot. This LOD is much lower than the ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 N protein from Bioss Inc. which has a reported LOD of 0.4 ng.mL \u22121 , implying very good sensitivity of our SARS-CoV-2 immunosensor. The detection experiments were performed in triplicates and the error bars in the calibration plot represent the standard deviations. The relative standard deviations (RSD%) of the experiments were ranging from 3.0 to 6.1%, implying very good reproducibility of the SARS-CoV-2 immunosensor. The stability of the biosensor was also tested by performing detection experiments after the storage of the immunosensor at 4\u00b0C for 10 days. There was no significant change in the biosensor response (1%) after storage and the RSD % were in the same range, 3.0 to 6.1%. It is worth noting that the immunosensor is easier to use compared with the other biosensors that needs an extraction step for the RNA [23, 24] . Moreover, the LOD of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein immunosensor was lower than all the other reported electrochemical biosensors for the same protein [28] [29] [30] [31] as shown in Table 1 .",

To this end, a control electrode (W2) was used on each sensor on which BSA was immobilized instead of the specific antibody for the SARS-CoV-2 N protein as shown in Scheme 1. Figure 5a shows the response of the immunosensor (W1) versus the response of the control electrode (W2) upon incubation of the sensor with 10 ng.mL \u22121 of the N protein solution. No significant response was seen in the case of the control electrode compared with the immunosensor response, indicating that the signal is generated from the specific binding of the antibody to the antigen and not due to any nonspecific adsorption. Moreover, it was highly important to study the cross reactivity of our immunosensor with antigens from other viruses that can show similar symptoms such as HCoV, MERS-CoV, Flu A and Flu B. Figure 5b shows the response of the immunosensor towards the SARS-CoV-2 N protein was much higher than the non-significant response against the other nonspecific antigens. These results indicate very good selectivity for our immunosensor. It is worth noting that the cross reactivity of the immunosensor with SARS-CoV is expected because there is more than 90% conserved similarity in protein sequences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [39] . Th manufacturer of the antibody used in this study (Sino Biological) has also reported cross reactivity with SARS-CoV. This cross reactivity has been previously reported for all the immunoassays using the N protein [29] . However, we believe that this cross reactivity does not have an impact on the current COVID 19 diagnosis because there are no new reported SARS-CoV outbreaks since 2004 [40] .",

The biosensor relies on the attachment of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody on gold nanoparticlesmodified carbon screen-printed electrodes. The detection was achieved in a label-free format via monitoring the change in the voltammetric reduction current upon binding of the immunosensor with the virus. Very good sensitivity was achieved, likely due to the fast electron transfer rate and the high surface area of the gold nanoparticles. Our immunosensor has lower cost, faster and showed lower detection limit than ELISA. The immunosensor showed a very good degree of selectivity for SARS-CoV-2 against other viruses such as HCoV, MERS-CoV, Flu A and Flu B. Cross reactivity of the biosensor with SARS-CoV is expected because of their similar structure. Initial application of our immunosensor in clinical samples showed good agreement with the RT-PCR results. Thus, the SARS-COV-2 immunosensor is considered a rapid, low-cost, selective and sensitive diagnostic method that has the capability to be integrated in a handheld potentiostat and controlled via regular cell phone for point-of-care testing. This work focuses on the detection of the nucleocapsid protein. However, the best antigen target for the detection of SARS-COV-2 has not been identified yet. Therefore, future work should focus on comparing the sensitivities using other target antigens such as spike and membrane proteins.

The SWV measurements were carried out in 5 mM ferro/ferricyanide redox couple solution in PBS buffer pH 7.4. The error bars represent the standard deviations of triplicate measurements change in the sensor response after storage, indicating good stability of the immunosensor.Application of the SARS-CoV-2 immunosensor in clinical samplesNasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from healthy and patient individuals and kept in UTM. The samples were first analysed with a RT-PCR kit which has a Ct cut-off value of 35. Two samples exhibited low Ct values(21 and 24), indicating a high number of virus copies and three samples showed high Ct values(33,32,31), indicating a low number of virus copies. The healthy sample is PCR negative. The samples were 1:10 diluted in PBS buffer pH 7.4 and then incubated on the immunosensors for 15 min.",
